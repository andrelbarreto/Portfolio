<!-- Section 1: Bio -->
   <p> I am a brazilian adventurer that started a professional and personal journey through technology and world travel about 25 years ago. </p>
   <p> I started programming at UNICAMP, one of Brasil's best universities as well as one responsible for development of fiber optics in South America in the early 90's. I graduated with the first technical degree in Data Processing (later renamed to Informatics), equivalent to a Technical High School. <p>
   <p> During my college and university years I worked as a freelancer programmer writing software in Pascal, Cobol, and C++ to companies as well as teaching Microsoft Office. I graduated in Communications, moved to the US as an International Correspondent writing articles about new economy and technology in both English and Portuguese for the largest Internet Portal in Latin America at the time (wwww.ig.com) and for the past decade I've worked in Experiential Marketing and Digital Marketing..<p>
   <p> My skills in Communications, Technology, Marketing and Linguistics have helped me to continue evolving in an ever changing workplace space.</p>
