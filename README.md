Portfolio showcasing my skills being built during Northwestern U Coding Bootcamp

This Portfolio Repository starts with a bio page built using HTML and CSS following some class specifications.
It is effectively the first assignment for the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp and is meant only for learning purposes until further notice.  Eventualy it will contain a portfolio with several projects linked to main page showcasing not only my skills in full stack web development but also how I apply my several years of expertise in Communications, Marketing and Digital Marketing to them.
